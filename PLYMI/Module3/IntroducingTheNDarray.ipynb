This is a very common  abbreviation to use.\n\nThe ND-array (N-dimensional array) is the star of the show for NumPy. This array simply stores a sequence of numbers. Like a Python list, you can access individual entries in this array by \"indexing\" into the array, and you can access a sub-sequence of the array by \"slicing\" it. So what distinguishes NumPy's ND-array from a Python list, and why is there a whole numerical library that revolves around this array? There are two major features that makes the ND-array special. It can:\n\n 1. Provide an interface for its underlying data to be accessed along multiple dimensions.\n 2. Rapidly perform mathematical operations over all of its elements, or over patterned subsequences of its elements, using compiled C code instead of Python; this is a process called vectorization.\n \nLet's take a sneak peek to see what this module has in store.
